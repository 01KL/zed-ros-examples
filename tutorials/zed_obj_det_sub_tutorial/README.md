# ZED video subscription tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn how to write a simple node that subscribes to messages of type "objects" (ZED custom message) to retrieve the list of objects detected by the ZED node.

*Note:* the Object Detection module is available only using a [ZED 2 camera](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed-2/)
